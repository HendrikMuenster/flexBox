# FlexBox - A **Flex**ible Primal-Dual Tool**Box**

## Introduction
**FlexBox** is a flexible MATLAB toolbox for finite dimensional convex variational problems in image processing and beyond

Nowadays, many problems in image processing consist of minimizing convex energies. Typically these problems can be written as

![Problem formulation][generalPrimalFormulation] ,

where ![A](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?A) denotes a linear operator and
![F](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?F) is a proper, convex and lower-semicontinuous function. This Problem refers to the so-called _primal_ formulation of the minimization problem and ![x in R^N](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x\in\mathbb{R}^N) is known as the primal variable we are interested in recovering.
